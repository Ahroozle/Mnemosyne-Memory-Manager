MemoryManager_Spike

The Mnemosyne and Luna Memory Managers were small projects I did on the side in my spare time as a way to keep myself sharp on C/++ syntax and pointer operations.

Mnemosyne manages a dynamic pool of memory and was practice for heap allocations and overriding new/delete among other exercises.
